## Hello there ! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

It's [**Fredy**](https://github.com/taboutsafredy), a SWE student from Space ;)

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently working on my personal project [@cutIt](#), a full-stack link shortening application that I'm building with TypeScript, React, and NodeJS.

I enjoy using [@Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and I've also contributed to improving it by creating plugins with over 950 installations, such as [@Node Screenshot](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=istfredy).

Outside of my studies and personal work, I spend my time meeting people and writing about what I'm learning in my SWE journey on LinkedIn. I also enjoy watching anime, with my favorite being **One Piece**.

## Let's connect!
